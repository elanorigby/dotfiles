### Set it up
1) Recommend manually creating `~/.dotfiles` and cloning into it because git will put it in a non-dot file automatically. If you care.

`git clone <url of repo> ~/.dotfiles`

2) run `./install` from within `~/.dotfiles`. This will take care of symlinking your
dot files to where ever you specified (probably the home folder).


#### Tmux
Install tmux `brew install tmux` if you haven't installed it yet.
run `$ tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`

#### Vim
run `:PlugInstall in vim`


### Initial Dotbot setup

in case I ever have to start from scratch again

1) create the directory in which you would like to store your dot files
for example: `mkdir ~/.dotfiles`

2) move your dot files into that folder EXCLUDING the dot

`mv ~/.vimrc ~/.dotfiles/vimrc`

3) cd into `~/.dotfiles` and do the git init and submodule stuff as instructed in
the Dotbot readme

4) edit your `install.conf.yaml` as instructed in the readme

5) run `./install` from within `~/.dotfiles`. This will take care of symlinking your
dot files to where ever you specified (probably the home folder).

6) git. commit. that shit.
